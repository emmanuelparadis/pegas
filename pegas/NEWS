		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.8-1.3


NEW FEATURES

    o as.igraph.haploNet() and as.network.haploNet() gains a new
      option, altlinks, to output the alternative links in the
      converted object (TRUE by default).


BUX FIXES

    o haplotype.DNAbin() ignored alignment gaps so that identical
      sequences were considered as different if they contained gaps.

    o alleles2loci() did not handle correctly its 'population' option.


OTHER CHANGES

    o Updated NAMESPACE file for r-devel.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.8-1


OTHER CHANGES

    o Minor correction in Fst.Rd.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.8


NEW FEATURES

    o Seven new functions (VCFloci, VCFheader, VCFlabels, rangePOS,
      is.snp.VCFinfo, selectQUAL, getINFO) are provided to read
      information from VCF files.

    o The new function alleles2loci transforms a matrix of alleles
      (typical for microsatellites) into an object of class "loci".

    o read.vcf() has been completely rewritten with new options.

    o hw.test() is now generic with methods for classes "loci" and
      "genind" (contributed by Thibaut Jombart).

    o is.snp() is now generic with methods for classes "loci" and
      "VCFinfo".

    o There is now a subset method for objects of class "haplotype"
      giving the possibility to select haplotypes with respect to
      their absolute frequency and/or frequency of missing data.

    o There is a new data set (jaguar) with microsatellites from four
      populations of jaguars.


BUG FIXES

    o Subsetting "loci" objects failed when some column names were the
      same (often when reading VCF files).

    o haploNet() failed when no alternative links were found.

    o amova() failed when the factors in the rhs of the formula were
      in a data frame. Thanks to Zhian Kamvar for the fix.


OTHER CHANGES

    o The vignette "ReadingFiles" has been revised and extended.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.7


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function geod calculates geodesic (aka great-circle)
      distances from coordinates in (decimal) degrees.

    o The new function geoTrans transforms strings such as
      43°12'34" into a numerical value.

    o The new function replot edits the layout of a haplotype network
      interactively or with specified coordinates (typically from a
      previous call to replot).

    o The new function diffHaplo outputs details of the differences
      between two haplotypes.

    o haploNet() now outputs alternative links of a haplotype network.

    o plot.haploNet() has been improved (a bit faster) and has a new
      option 'threshold' to control how alternative links of the
      network are displayed.

    o The option 'show.mutation' of plot.haploNet() has been extended.


OTHER CHANGES

    o haplotype() now takes base ambiguities into account when
      comparing sequences. For consistency, haploNet() now uses
      pairwise deletion when comparing sequences of haplotypes.

    o The attribute "CHR" returned by read.vcf() is now character (was
      integer before).



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.6


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function read.vcf reads VCF files.

    o The new function is.snp tests whether a locus is a SNP.

    o The new function is.phased tests whether a genotype is phased.

    o The new function proba.genotype computes expected genotype
      probabilities under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all levels
      of ploidy and any number of alleles.

    o The new function haplotype.loci extracts haplotypes from phased
      genotypic data.

    o The new function dist.haplotype.loci computes distances among
      haplotypes extracted from loci data.

    o Two new functions, LD and LD2, test for linkage disequilibrium
      with phased and unphased genotypes, respectively.

    o haplotype() is now generic with methods for "DNAbin" and "loci"
      objects.

    o There is a sort() method for objects of class "haplotype".

    o expand.genotype() now works with all levels of ploidy and any
      number of alleles.


BUG FIXES

    o site.spectrum( , folded = FALSE) dit not work correctly.

    o Genotypes with alleles not separated by the default slash (e.g.,
      a|A) were not read correctly.

    o Reordering of alleles has been improved: alleles are now always
      sorted alphabetically within an unphased genotype, e.g., a/A is
      changed to A/a even if A/a was not observed (this was not the
      case before).

    o hw.test() now checks more carefully for ploidy level and accepts
      data with mixed levels of ploidy.


OTHER CHANGES

    o amova() now checks that the term(s) in the rhs of the formula is
      (are) factor(s).

    o Plotting haplotype networks with pies can now be done with
      user-chosen colours for the slices (thanks to Marius Wenzel for
      pointing this out).

    o tajima.test() now returns a warning with less than 4
      observations as this test cannot be done in this situation (an
      error occured before).



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.5-1


NEW FEATURES

    o MMD() now plots the expected distribution of mismatches under
      the assumption of a stable population together with the
      empirical curve (contribution by David Winter). The new option
      'lty' can specify the types of lines. The legend is now at the
      top of the plot.


BUG FIXES

    o theta.tree() returned estimates of Theta divided by 2 (scaled on
      Nu). The estimates are now correct (ie, scaled on 2Nu).



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.5


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function theta.msat computes THETA from micro-satellite
      data using three different estimators.

    o The new function haploFreq extracts the haplotype frequencies,
      possibly using the labels of the original sequences; see
      ?haploFreq for details.

    o plot.haploNet() has the new option 'show.mutation' to display
      the mutations on the links of the network.


OTHER CHANGES

    o Improved DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files.

    o The packages igraph and network are no more required.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.4-5


OTHER CHANGES

    o Improved NAMESPACE file.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.4-4


NEW FEATURES

    o theta.tree() has a new option, analytical = TRUE, to compute
      THETA and its standard-error with analytical formulae. If FALSE,
      a numerical optimisation is done (as in previous versions).

    o The function mst (minimum spanning tree) has been moved from ape
      to pegas with a new code.


BUG FIXES

    o hw.test() should have one less ddl to its chi2 tests (thanks to
      Gabriel Terraz for the fix).

    o Extracting sequence(s) from an object of class "haplotype" could
      not be printed correctly: this is fixed with a new '[' method
      for this class.

    o The reference to Chakraborty and Weiss (1991) was corrected
      thanks to Kari Vepsäläinen.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.4-3


OTHER CHANGES

    o Changed some coding in summary.loci().



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.4-2


BUG FIXES

    o amova() did not randomize correctly at the highest level,
      resulting in P-values that were always equal to 1.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.4-1


BUG FIXES

    o site.spectrum(, folded = FALSE) failed.

    o The variances returned by nuc.div() were inflated (thanks to
      Paulina Ossa for the report).



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.4


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function rr.test by Alastair Potts performs Tajima's test
      of a molecular clock (Genetics, 1993, 135:599).

    o haploNet() has a new argument 'd = NULL' to specify an
      alternative distance matrix among haplotypes.

    o There are two new functions, as.network.haploNet() and
      as.igraph.haploNet() for converting networks of class
      "haploNet" towards other packages.


BUG FIXES

    o plot.haploNet() has now by default asp = 1.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.3-4


OTHER CHANGES

    o The help command ?loci now points to the man page of read.loci()
      where this class is described.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.3-3


BUG FIXES

    o read.loci() failed with haploid data. It also failed in some
      situations with the population column. The default behaviour is now
      more flexible and more reliable.

    o Variance components were not correctly computed by amova() in the
      single-level case.

    o print.amova() did not work correctly when amova() was called with
      'nperm = 0'.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.3-2


BUG FIXES

    o A bug was fixed in Fst().



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.3-1


OTHER CHANGES

    o The default of 'loci.sep' in read.loci() is now "".



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.3


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function edit.loci allows to edit allelic data frame while
      keeping the attributes correct (which edit.data.frame doesn't).

    o There are new rbind() and cbind() methods for objects of class
      "loci".

    o There is a print 'method' for the class "haplotype".

    o `[.loci` has now an option 'drop = TRUE'.

    o There is a vignette detailing how to read allelic data files of
      various formats into R: type vignette("ReadingFiles") in R.


BUG FIXES

    o amova() did not compute SSD correctly with a single level.

    o getAlleles() did not work correctly.

    o read.loci() did not work when 'col.pop' was used.

    o Checking for ordered alleles did not work (i.e, A/a and a/A were
      treated as different genotypes: they are now pooled).

    o The display of haplotype labels by plot.haploNet() was not
      effective.


OTHER CHANGES

    o read.loci() loses the 'skip' option which is replaced by '...'.



		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.2


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function site.spectrum computes the (un)folded site
      frequency spectrum of a set of DNA sequences.

    o The new function theta.tree estimates THETA from a phylogenetic tree
      under a simple coalescent model by maximum likelihood.

    o There is now a "[" method for the class "loci".

    o haplotype() has now an option 'labels' to give as rownames of
      the returned object.

    o amova() has a new option 'is.squared' to specify whether the
      distance matrix has been squared beforefand (FALSE by default).

    o write.loci() has a new argument '...' passed to write.table().

    o The functions heterozygosity, nuc.div, theta.h, theta.k and
      theta.s have been moved from ape to pegas.


BUG FIXES

    o amova() did not compute SSD correctly.

    o summary.loci() failed in the presence of NA's.
