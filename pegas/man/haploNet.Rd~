\title{Haplotype Networks}
\description{
  \code{haploNet} computes a haplotype network. There is a plot method
  and two conversion functions towards other packages.
}
\usage{
haploNet(h, d = NULL)
\method{plot}{haploNet}(x, size = 1, col = "black", bg = "white",
     col.link = "black", lwd = 1, lty = 1, pie = NULL,
     labels = TRUE, font = 2, cex = 1, scale.ratio = 1,
     asp = 1, legend = FALSE, fast = FALSE, show.mutation = TRUE, ...)
\method{as.network}{haploNet}(x, directed = FALSE, ...)
\method{as.igraph}{haploNet}(x, directed = FALSE, use.labels = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{h}{an object of class \code{"haplotype"}.}
  \item{d}{an object giving the distances among haplotypes (see details).}
  \item{x}{an object of class \code{"haploNet"}.}
  \item{size}{a numeric vector giving the diameter of the circles
    representing the haplotypes: this is in the same unit than the links
    and eventually recycled.}
  \item{col}{a character vector specifying the colours of the circles;
    eventually recycled.}
  \item{bg}{a character vector specifying either the colours of the
    background of the circles (if \code{pie = NULL}), or the colours of
    the slices of the pies; eventually recycled.}
  \item{col.link}{a character vector specifying the colours of the links;
    eventually recycled.}
  \item{lwd}{a numeric vector giving the width of the links; eventually
    recycled.}
  \item{lty}{idem for the line types.}
  \item{pie}{a matrix used to draw pie charts for each haplotype; its
    number of rows must be equal to the number of haplotypes.}
  \item{labels}{a logical specifying whether to identify the haplotypes
    with their labels (the default).}
  \item{font}{the font used for these labels (bold by default); must be
    an integer between 1 and 4.}
  \item{cex}{a numerical specifying the character expansion of the labels.}
  \item{scale.ratio}{the ratio of the scale of the links representing
    the number of steps on the scale of the circles representing the
    haplotypes. It may be needed to give a value greater than one to
    avoid overlapping circles.}
  \item{asp}{the aspect ratio of the plot. Do not change the default
    unless you want to distort your network.}
  \item{legend}{a logical specifying whether to draw the legend, or a
    vector of length two giving the coordinates where to draw the
    legend; \code{FALSE} by default. If \code{TRUE}, the user is asked
    to click where to draw the legend.}
  \item{fast}{a logical specifying whether to optimize the spacing of
    the circles; \code{FALSE} by default.}
  \item{show.mutation}{a logical specifying whether to display the
    mutations on the links of the network.}
  \item{directed}{a logical specifying whether the network is directed
    (\code{FALSE} by default).}
  \item{use.labels}{a logical specifying whether to use the original
    labels in the returned network.}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments passed to \code{plot}.}
}
\details{
  By default, the haplotype network is built using an infinite site
  model (i.e., uncorrected or Hamming distance). Users may specify their
  own distance with the argument \code{d}. Currently, there is no check
  of labels, so the user must make sure that the distances are ordered
  in the same way than the haplotypes.

  Another potential issue is that, by default, the distances are
  calculated with global deletion of missing data (columns with at least
  one ambiguous base are removed before computing the distances). This
  may be problematic if there are many ambiguous bases resulting in
  pairs of haplotypes separated by zero-distance. To remedy this, the
  distances can be calculated with \code{dist.dna(h, "N",
  pairwise.deletion = TRUE)}.
}
\note{
  If two haplotypes are very different, \code{haploNet} will likely fail
  (error during integration due to non-finite values).
}
\value{
  \code{haploNet} returns an object of class \code{"haploNet"} which is
  a matrix where each row represents a link in the network, the first
  and second columns give the numbers of the linked haplotypes, the
  third column, named \code{"step"}, gives the number of steps in this
  link, and the fourth column, named \code{"Prob"}, gives the
  probability of a parsimonious link as given by Templeton et
  al. (1992). There are two additional attributes: \code{"freq"}, the
  absolute frequencies of each haplotype, and \code{"labels"}, their
  labels.

  \code{as.network} and \code{as.igraph} return objects of the
  appropriate class.

\examples{
## generate some artificial data from 'woodmouse':
data(woodmouse)
x <- woodmouse[sample(15, size = 110, replace = TRUE), ]
h <- haplotype(x)
(net <- haploNet(h))
plot(net)
## symbol sizes equal to haplotype sizes:
plot(net, size = attr(net, "freq"), fast = TRUE)
plot(net, size = attr(net, "freq"))
plot(net, size=attr(net, "freq"), scale.ratio = 2, cex = 0.8)
