\title{Read Allelic Data Files}
\description{
  This function reads allelic data from a text file: rows are
  individuals, and columns are loci and optional variables. By default,
  the first line of the file gives the locus names. If one column is
  labelled `population', it is taken as a population variable.
}
\usage{
read.loci(file, header = TRUE, loci.sep = "", allele.sep = "/|",
          col.pop = NULL, col.loci = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a file name specified by either a variable of mode character,
    or a quoted string.}
  \item{header}{a logical specifying whether the first line of the data
    file gives the names of the loci (\code{TRUE} by default).}
  \item{loci.sep}{the character(s) separating the loci (columns) in the
    data file (a white space by default).}
  \item{allele.sep}{the character(s) separating the alleles for each locus
    in the data file (a forward slash by default).}
  \item{col.pop}{specifies whether one of the column of the data file
    identifies the population. By default, if one column is labelled
    `population' (case-insensitive), it is taken as the population
    variable; otherwise an integer giving the number of the column or a
    character string giving its name. It is eventually renamed
    `population' and transformed as a factor.}
  \item{col.loci}{a vector of integers or characters specifying the
    indices or the names of the columns that are loci. By default, all
    columns are taken as loci except the population one, if present or
    specified.}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments passed to \code{read.table} (e.g.,
    \code{row.names}).}
}
\details{
  The rownames of the returned object identify the individual genotypes;
  they are either taken from the data file if present, or given the
  values \code{"1"}, \code{"2"}, \dots Similarly for the colnames: if
  absent in the file (in which case \code{header = FALSE} must be set),
  they are given the values \code{"V1"}, \code{"V2"}, \dots

  In the returned genotypes, alleles are separated by \code{"/"}, even
  if it is not the case in the data file.

  The vignette ``Reading Genetic Data Files Into R with \pkg{adegenet}
  and \pkg{pegas}'' explains how to read various file formats including
  Excel files (type \code{vignette("ReadingFiles")} in R).

}
\value{
  A data frame with class \code{c("loci", "data.frame")}. It is a data
  frame with an attribute \code{"locicol"} specifying the columns that
  must be treated as loci. The latter are factors. The other columns can
  be of any type.
