\title{Haplotype Networks}
\description{
  \code{haploNet} computes a haplotype network. There is a plot method
  and two conversion functions towards other packages.
}
\usage{
haploNet(h, d = NULL)
\method{plot}{haploNet}(x, size = 1, col = "black", bg = "white",
     col.link = "black", lwd = 1, lty = 1, pie = NULL,
     labels = TRUE, font = 2, cex = 1, scale.ratio = 1,
     asp = 1, legend = FALSE, fast = FALSE, show.mutation = TRUE,
     threshold = c(1, 2), ...)
\method{as.network}{haploNet}(x, directed = FALSE, altlinks = TRUE, ...)
\method{as.igraph}{haploNet}(x, directed = FALSE, use.labels = TRUE,
        altlinks = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{h}{an object of class \code{"haplotype"}.}
  \item{d}{an object giving the distances among haplotypes (see details).}
  \item{x}{an object of class \code{"haploNet"}.}
  \item{size}{a numeric vector giving the diameter of the circles
    representing the haplotypes: this is in the same unit than the links
    and eventually recycled.}
  \item{col}{a character vector specifying the colours of the circles;
    eventually recycled.}
  \item{bg}{a character vector specifying either the colours of the
    background of the circles (if \code{pie = NULL}), or the colours of
    the slices of the pies; eventually recycled.}
  \item{col.link}{a character vector specifying the colours of the links;
    eventually recycled.}
  \item{lwd}{a numeric vector giving the width of the links; eventually
    recycled.}
  \item{lty}{idem for the line types.}
  \item{pie}{a matrix used to draw pie charts for each haplotype; its
    number of rows must be equal to the number of haplotypes.}
  \item{labels}{a logical specifying whether to identify the haplotypes
    with their labels (the default).}
  \item{font}{the font used for these labels (bold by default); must be
    an integer between 1 and 4.}
  \item{cex}{a numerical specifying the character expansion of the labels.}
  \item{scale.ratio}{the ratio of the scale of the links representing
    the number of steps on the scale of the circles representing the
    haplotypes. It may be needed to give a value greater than one to
    avoid overlapping circles.}
  \item{asp}{the aspect ratio of the plot. Do not change the default
    unless you want to distort your network.}
  \item{legend}{a logical specifying whether to draw the legend, or a
    vector of length two giving the coordinates where to draw the
    legend; \code{FALSE} by default. If \code{TRUE}, the user is asked
    to click where to draw the legend.}
  \item{fast}{a logical specifying whether to optimize the spacing of
    the circles; \code{FALSE} by default.}
  \item{show.mutation}{a logical or a numeric value: if 0 (or FALSE)
    nothing is drawn on the links; if 1 (or TRUE) the mutations are
    shown with small dots on the links; if 2 the number of mutations are
    printed on the links.}
  \item{threshold}{a numeric vector with two values (or 0) giving the
    lower and upper numbers of mutations for alternative links to be
    displayed. If \code{threshold = 0}, alternative links are not drawn
    at all.}
  \item{directed}{a logical specifying whether the network is directed
    (\code{FALSE} by default).}
  \item{use.labels}{a logical specifying whether to use the original
    labels in the returned network.}
  \item{altlinks}{whether to output the alternative links when
    converting to another class; \code{TRUE} by default.}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments passed to \code{plot}.}
}
\details{
  By default, the haplotype network is built using an infinite site
  model (i.e., uncorrected or Hamming distance) of DNA sequences and
  pairwise deletion of missing data (see \code{\link[ape]{dist.dna}})
  Users may specify their own distance with the argument \code{d}. There
  is no check of labels, so the user must make sure that the distances
  are ordered in the same way than the haplotypes.
}
\note{
  If two haplotypes are very different, \code{haploNet} will likely fail
  (error during integration due to non-finite values).
}
\value{
  \code{haploNet} returns an object of class \code{"haploNet"} which is
  a matrix where each row represents a link in the network, the first
  and second columns give the numbers of the linked haplotypes, the
  third column, named \code{"step"}, gives the number of steps in this
  link, and the fourth column, named \code{"Prob"}, gives the
  probability of a parsimonious link as given by Templeton et
  al. (1992). There are three additional attributes: \code{"freq"}, the
  absolute frequencies of each haplotype, \code{"labels"}, their labels,
  and \code{"alter.links"}, the alternative links of the network.

  \code{as.network} and \code{as.igraph} return objects of the
  appropriate class.

\examples{
## generate some artificial data from 'woodmouse':
data(woodmouse)
x <- woodmouse[sample(15, size = 110, replace = TRUE), ]
h <- haplotype(x)
(net <- haploNet(h))
plot(net)
## symbol sizes equal to haplotype sizes:
plot(net, size = attr(net, "freq"), fast = TRUE)
plot(net, size = attr(net, "freq"))
plot(net, size=attr(net, "freq"), scale.ratio = 2, cex = 0.8)
